Low-latency monitor/tx settings

Setup, Audio, VAC1 (not implemented on VAC2 yet)

Driver:		Windows WASAPI
Input: 		Your input device (preferably the same one as the output device)
Output:		Your output device (preferably the same one as input device)

Exclusive:	

********************************************************************************
Checked. Settings must *match* the device you are using, as there will be 
no internal bitdepth, samplerate etc resampling.
********************************************************************************
Buffer Size: 	As low as you can get away with, without audio 'artifacts'
Sample Rate:	MUST match the *native* samplerate of your sound card.

With careful settings, I have managed a total latency of 40ms. YMMV, depending
on your system / drivers installed, etc/

IMPORTANT:

Buffer Latency(ms)
Set ALL to manual and buffer sizes to zero

IMPORTANT AGAIN:
VAC1 Monitor:	Tick 'Force' in both boxes, and ensure 1.00000 is entered ito both
		numeric boxes.

In Windows:
		Control Panel, Hardware and Sound/Sound/ Manage Audio Devices
		Set the highest sample rate available for your device.

		Do this by clicking 'Properties' for the device(s) you use
		(remember both 'Playback' AND 'Recording') then go to the
		Advanced tab and set the format to the highest sample rate.

		If using two different in/out devices, the sample rate, bit depth
		and channel mode should be IDENTICAL across the two devices.
		Exclusive mode bypasses a lot of stuff, lowering the latency, but
		this means that NO resampling or matching of audio takes place. This
		is why they must be the same!
